#Design Driven Development Tool v0.2.5

**Design Driven Development Tool** is a design testing framework for developers. Users input the URL they wish to test and a local file with the original mock-ups. 3DT visits the site, takes a screenshot and compares the screenshot to the original plans. Discrepancies are presented with red highlighting.

Accurate. Reliable. Fast. 3DT.
